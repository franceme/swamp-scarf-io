= SWAMP SCARF IO libraries

ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

The https://wwwm.continuousassurnace.com[Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP)]
runs software assurance tools, and converts the results of each tool into a
common format called SCARF (SWAMP Common Assessment Result Format).
This repository contains a set of libraries that allows a client to read and
write SCARF data from programs written in Perl, Python, C, C++ and Java
(read only).
SCARF was originally an XML based file format, but there is an experimental
JSON file format supported.

For documentation on SCARF see link:docs/SCARF.pdf[docs/SCARF.pdf]

Documentation for each language can be found in the appropriate directory.
