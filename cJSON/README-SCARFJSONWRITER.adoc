=== NAME
ScarfJSONWriter - A C library for writing SCARF JSON files

=== SYNOPSIS
[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include "ScarfJSONWriter.c"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ScarfJSONWriter *writer = NewScarfJSONWriterForFilename("/path/to/file/", "UTF-8");
    if (writer == NULL) {
        printf("failed to create writer\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    SetErrorLevel(writer, 1);
    SetPretty(writer, 1);
    
    char *bugErrors = CheckBug(bugInformation);
    char *metricErrors = CheckMetric(metricInformation);
    char *initalErrors = CheckStart(initialInformation);

    AddStartTag(writer, initialInformation);
    AddBug(writer, bugInformation);

    AddSummary(writer);
    AddEndTag(writer);

    DeleteScarfJSONWriter(writer);
     
    return 0;

=== DESCRIPTION
This library provides the ability to convert C data structures into SWAMP Common Assesment Results Format (SCARF) JSON formatted documents. It is dependent on yajl, which is used to handle writing of the SCARF document.

The writer's output is determined by the user through method calls that provide the data to be written. The data is provided as C structures shown below.

The user has the ability to set the error level to 0 (none), 1 (warnings), or 2 (exit). Both error levels 1 and 2 will print all error messages found during writing including misformatted elements, required elements not found, wrong value types, and ordering violations. Error level 2 will also exit the program as soon as an error is found to ensure validity of results.

=== METHODS
==== ScarfJSONWriter *NewScarfJSONWriterFilename(char *filename, char *encoding)
Initializes a ScarfJSONWriter struct. Opens a file stream from the file represented by the filename with UTF-8 validation set to enable. To disable UTF-8 validation see the SetUTF8 method.

==== ScarfJSONWriter *NewScarfJSONWriterFromFd(int fd, char *encoding)
Initializes a ScarfJSONWriter struct. Opens a file stream from the given file descriptor with the specified encoding. Supported encodings include UTF-8 (default), UTF-16, ISO-Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), and ASCII. 

==== ScarfJSONWriter *NewScarfJSONWriterFromFile(FILE *file)
Initializes a ScarfJSONWriter struct with the given file with UTF-8 validation set to enable. To disable UTF-8 validation see the SetUTF8 method.

==== ScarfJSONWriter *NewScarfJSONWriterFromString(char *s, int *size)
Initializes a ScarfJSONWriter struct to write to a specified address in memory. s is a initial char pointer, size contains the total amount of memory occupied by the string. Vy default UTF-8 validation set to enable. To disable UTF-8 validation see the SetUTF8 method.

==== void SetPretty(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo, int pretty_en) 
Either enable or disable pretty printing with a true or false value (default true). Returns 0 or 1 if error changing settings.

==== int SetErrorLevel(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo, int errorLevel)
Allows changing the errorlevel of the writer to 0 (none), 1 (print warnings), or 2 (print warnings and exit). If ERRORLEVEL does not equal one of these value returns 1 and does nothing.

==== void SetUTF8 (ScarfJSONWriter * writerInfo, int utf8)
Allows enabling/disabling of UTF8 validation. Any true value will enable validation, and 0 will disable validation.

==== JSONTextWriterPtr GetWriter(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo)
Returns the JSONTextWriter used for writing.

==== int GetPretty (ScarfJSONWriter * writerInfo)
Returns current value set to pretty_en. 

==== int GetUTF8 (ScarfJSONWriter * writerInfo)
Returns current value set for UTF-8 validation.

==== int GetErrorLevel(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo)
Returns the current error level.

==== char *CheckStart(Initial *initialInformation)
Checks an Initial data structure for errors. Returns a string containing all errors found seperated by newlines, otherwise returns NULL. The return  value must be freed by the user.

==== char *CheckBug(BugInstance *bugInformation)
Checks a BugInstance data structure for errors. Returns a string containing all errors found seperated by newlines, otherwise returns NULL. The return value must be freed by the user.

==== char *CheckMetric(Metric *metricInformation)
Checks a Metric data structure for errors. Returns a string containing all errors found seperated by newlines, otherwise returns NULL. The return value must be freed by the user.

==== AddStartTag(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo, Initial *initialInformation)
Writes a start tag to the file based on initialInformation. For details on valid data structures see below. Must be called exactly once before other 'Add' methods below.

==== AddBug(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo, BugInstance *bugInformation)
Writes a bug to the file based on bugInformation. For details on valid data structures see below. May be called 0 or more time and inter-leaved with 'AddMetric' calls. Not allowed after 'AddSummary' and 'AddEndTag'.

==== AddMetric(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo, Metric *metricInformation)
Writes a metric to the file based on metricInformation. For details on valid data structures see below. May be called 0 or more time and inter-leaved with 'AddBug' calls. Not allowed after 'AddSummary' and 'AddEndTag'.

==== AddSummary(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo)
Writes a summary to the file based on all bugs and metrics already written with this writer. May be called at most once before 'AddEndTag'.

==== AddEndTag(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo)
Writes an end tag to the file. Must be called exactly once after which no other 'Add' methods may be called.

==== void DeleteScarfJSONWriter(ScarfJSONWriter *writerInfo)
Frees writer and closes any opened files opened by the writer.
